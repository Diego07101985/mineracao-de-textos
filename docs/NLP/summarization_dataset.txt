Abstract. Text summarization consists in generating a shorter version
of an input document, which captures its main ideas. Despite the recent
developments in this area, most of the existing techniques have been
tested mostly in English and Chinese, due in part to the low availability
of datasets in other languages. In addition, experiments have been run
mostly on collections of news articles, which could lead to some bias in
the research. In this paper, we address both these limitations by creating
a dataset for the summarization of legal texts in Portuguese. The dataset,
called RulingBR, contains about 10K rulings from the Brazilian Federal
Supreme Court. We describe how the dataset was assembled and we also
report on the results of standard summarization methods which may
serve as a baseline for future works.

Introduction

Text summarization is an important task in Natural Language Processing. It
consists in generating a shorter version of the text given as input, capturing
its main ideas. In the last few years, summarization has undergone signiﬁcant developments. Notably, many of the new techniques being applied rely on
deep learning strategies to go beyond the previously established state-of-the-art
results [19,22,25,26]. Despite the recent boom in this area, the majority of works
have been using English and Chinese datasets due in part to the low availability
of resources in other languages.
Another limitation of the current research is that it focuses on news articles,
for which the task consists in generating the headline or a very short summary.
For example, models trained on the DUC-2004 task can only generate summaries
of up to 75 characters [14,19], and the input consists of only one or two sentences.
News articles usually begin with a teaser sentence used as a catch for the
reader, which sums up the contents of the full article. So, the task of guessing
the title can generally obtain good results by simply extracting the ﬁrst few
words of the article. The excessive focus on this type of text introduces bias in
the techniques being developed. For example, Google’s Textsum model [24] for

summarization uses just the ﬁrst two paragraphs of the article. Another possible
approach is to weight the sentences in descending order from the start, in favor
of the ﬁrst few sentences [23].
We believe there is a need for datasets with diﬀerent text styles and longer
summaries with contents taken from several parts of the input. This would allow
a more realistic setting and potential for employing summarization in a wider
set of applications.
In this paper, we report on the creation of RulingBR – a dataset for the
summarization of legal texts in Portuguese containing over 10K decisions from
the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court. Our contribution aims at addressing two
limitations of the research in summarization: (i) the low availability of resources
for languages other than English and Chinese, and (ii) the excessive focus on
summarizing news articles. We have assembled a language resource in Portuguese
to enable the development of methods for this language. The second contribution
is to do with the style of the texts, which will contribute to a greater variety in
the research on summarization.

Related Work

There are a few datasets that have been used for evaluating summarization techniques on generic domains. The following are available in Brazilian Portuguese.
TeM´
ario [17] is composed of 100 news articles. Each text contains a pair of
reference summaries: one was made by a human an the other was automatically generated.
Summ-it [6] is an annotated corpus that contains anaphoric coreferences. These
are newspaper articles annotated from the Brazilian Folha de S˜
ao Paulo
newspaper.
CSTNews [1] is another annotated corpus. It is composed of 50 text collections
and each collection has about four documents. It uses texts from the following
Brazilian news sources Folha de S˜
ao Paulo, Estad˜
ao, O Globo, Jornal do
Brasil, and Gazeta do Povo.
The most widely used datasets are available in English and are described
below.
The Annotated Gigaword [18] is the largest static corpus of English news
documents available [15]. It contains over 10 million documents from seven
news sources, annotated with syntactic and discourse structure. It was not
speciﬁcally built to be a summarization dataset, but it has been used for this
purpose by simulating that the headline would be a summary of the article.
CNN/Daily Mail was purposely designed for summarization as each article
comes paired with a short set of summarized bullet points that represent the
highlights of the text. It is frequently used for question answering [5] and is
composed of about 300 thousand articles.

Opinosis [8] contains customer reviews about a product they bought. Each
product description has ﬁve reviews. This is a small dataset containing only
51 articles.
DUC1 stands for Document Understanding Conference. It has run a speciﬁc
summarization track since 2001. In 2008, DUC became a summarization track
inside the Text Analysis Conferences (TAC). These datasets contain humanproduced per-document and multiple document summaries.
RulingBR diﬀers from these related datasets because in the legal domain,
documents are generally lengthier and their structure is very diﬀerent from
the structure of news articles. As a consequence, the assumption that the most
important ideas will be in the ﬁrst few sentences is not valid.

A Summarization Dataset with Legal Documents

For the purpose of text summarization in the legal domain, we searched for a
source with a large number of publicly available documents. Thus, we chose to use
the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) as our source. The STF is the highest court
in Brazil and has the ﬁnal word interpreting the country’s Federal Constitution.
All of its decisions must be published online and are available in its internet
portal2 .
3.1

Structure of the Documents

The full decision document, called (inteiro teor ), is composed of four parts,
namely: “Ementa”, “Ac´
ord˜
ao”, “Relat´
orio”, and “Voto”, which we now describe.
– The Ementa is a brief summary of the main topics discussed in each case
and how the judges decided. We will be using the Ementa as the reference
summary that automatic methods should aim to produce. In our corpus, the
size of the Ementa was typically around 7% of the size of the full content.
– The Ac´
ord˜
ao is a brief description of how each judge has decided and what
the ﬁnal decision was. This section represents around 2% of the full content.
– The Relat´
orio, meaning report, is a compilation of the main arguments and
events that happened during the trial. In general, this section accounts for
about 22% of the full content.
– The last section, called Voto, may contain one vote, in case that the other
judges agree with the ﬁrst judge, or individual votes for each judge, otherwise.
Because the votes need to address all the points raised by the petitioners, this
tends to be the largest section covering around 69% of the full content.
The Ementa is useful for lawyers and other legal professionals when they
are searching for decisions about a given topic. A good text should not be long,
generally less than one page, making it a good summary of the full decision.

Data Collection

In order to obtain the documents, the Scrapy [21] library was used to browse
the search pages and to download the documents. Only a few documents from
the years 2010 and 2011 could be successfully parsed. Thus most documents are
dated from 2012 to 2018.
The raw text we obtained contains some undesired pieces of texts such as
headings, footers, page numbers, etc. We used regular expressions to identify the
starting and ending points of each section of interest and remove unwanted text.
Finally, the text of the sections was dumped as a JSON object, one object per
line.
In Fig. 1, we show an extract from a short document in the ﬁnal JSON format.
The ellipsis indicates the omission of content to save space.
The ﬁnal ﬁle has about 173 MB and contains 10,623 decisions and can
be downloaded from https://github.com/diego-feijo/rulingbr. There are around
26 million tokens in the entire dataset.
We investigated whether there is a correlation between the length (in tokens)
of the Ementa section and all other sections combined (full document). This
correlation would be important for us to determine the desired summary size
when using the automatic summarizers. The calculated correlation coeﬃcient
was 0.39, which is considered weak and is reﬂected by a large dispersion.

Evaluating Summarization Systems on RulingBR

In this Section, we present results of out-of-the-box extractive summarization
strategies on RulingBR dataset. The goal is to provide baseline results for future
summarization techniques.
4.1

Experimental Setup

In order to establish some baselines using this corpus, we have run a few automatic summarization experiments using two common libraries.

RulingBR: A Summarization Dataset for Legal Texts

259

The ﬁrst library used was Gensim [20]. This is a software framework for Natural Language Processing that implements some popular algorithms for topical
inference and has a TextRank implementation for summarization. This library
implements a variation of the TextRank [13] algorithm.
The second library used was the Sumy package [3]. It has a large variety of
algorithms implemented using a common interface which makes it easier to run
and compare the results.
The choice of summarization algorithms was motivated by the fact that they
could be applied directly to the text without requiring additional information
such as part-of-speech tags or headlines.
The algorithms used in this experiment were the following.
TextRank uses a graph-based ranking model for text processing. This algorithm
applies unsupervised methods for keyword and sentence extraction and is
based on ideas borrowed from HITS [10] and PageRank [16]. Both Gensim
and Sumy implement variations of the TextRank algorithm. The Gensim
implementation was improved [2] replacing the cosine by the Okapi-BM25
similarity function.
Luhn [12], which uses statistical information derived from word frequency and
distribution to compute a relative measure of signiﬁcance, ﬁrst for words and
then for sentences. The set of sentences with the highest scores are extracted
to make up the summary.
LexRank [7] is a graph-based method to compute a relative measure of importance which is based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of the sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on
intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix for the graph
representation of sentences.
4.2

Evaluation Metrics

The most commonly used metric for evaluating summarization algorithms is
Rouge [11], which stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. Its goal is to provide a measure of quality of an automatically generated
summaries in comparison against a reference summary produced by humans.
The Rouge metric checks for overlapping text segments between the automatically generated summary and the reference summary. Diﬀerent levels of granularity can be used. Rouge-1 counts the occurrences unigrams that appear in
the automatically generated and the reference summaries. Rouge-2, counts how
many bigrams were found (in the same order). Rouge-L stands for the longest
common sub-sequence between the automatically generated and the reference
summaries.
4.3

Experimental Procedure

Although both libraries used in the experiments support stopword removal, stemming, and tokenization, we opted to apply it beforehand as preprocessing steps

260

D. de Vargas Feij´
o and V. P. Moreira

to make sure that the same operations were applied in all settings. For most
of the stages, we have used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [4], which
is a widely used library for processing of natural language documents. It contains functions and trained models in many languages. We used this library for
ﬁltering, stemming, and tokenization.
Stopword Removal – In order to try to make a fair analysis of the content produced in the summaries, stopwords should be removed since their presence could
artiﬁcially inﬂate the quality metrics (since the reference summaries would certainly contain many such words). We have used the Portuguese stop-list provided
with NLTK. Also, we have ﬁltered any token with fewer than two characters.
This was done because these tokens have low discrimination power, and, as we
are generating a summary, we expect that the words should contain relevant
semantic meaning.
Stemming – This technique conﬂates the variant forms of words into a single
stem. We used the NLTK implementation of the RSLP-Stemmer [9].
Tokenization – This is the task of separating the text into chunks. It is used for
dividing the text into sentences and them into words. Recognizing the start and
end of sentences is crucial for the extractive summarization algorithms because
they will compute the score of each sentence and output the highest scored
sentences. The tokenizer must identify situations such as when sentences were
not being ﬁnished by a period (e.g. Hurry up!) or when a period was being used
for an abbreviation (e.g. Mr. John) rather than to indicate the end of a sentence.
Again, we used the NLTK implementation of the Punkt tokenizer trained for the
Portuguese language.
Standardization – The documents in the corpus signiﬁcantly vary in length
due to the several subjects that are covered by the decisions. In order to try to
generalize a pattern, some outliers needed to be dropped. Using a token (word)
as measuring unit, we calculated the mean and the standard deviation for the
summaries (99.53 ± 91.17) and for the full contents (1397.44 ± 2101.73). In
order to reduce the dispersion, we removed outliers. Input documents with fewer
than 300 words or more than the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation were
treated as outliers. In a similar fashion, summaries with fewer than 19 words
or more than the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation were also removed.
With this standardization, we removed 616 decisions, which represent 5.80%
of the total. Full contents mean became 1200.65, with a standard deviation
of 893.86; Summary mean became 91.79, with a standard deviation of 62.92.
The frequency distribution after the cleaning can be seen in the histograms
of Fig. 2.
4.4

Model Parameters

It is important to notice that the evaluation scores could be aﬀected by the size
of the generated summaries. That happens because a longer summary would
probably have a greater recall and, as consequence, a higher Rouge score.

RulingBR: A Summarization Dataset for Legal Texts

261

Fig. 2. Frequency distribution of the length of the summaries and the full content of
the documents.

The libraries that generate automatic summaries receive as parameter the
size of the desired output. As we discussed earlier, there is no strong correlation
between the length of the document and the length of the summary. As shown
in the histograms of Fig. 2, the size of the reference summaries can vary roughly
between 30 and 150 tokens. So, setting the desired summary size to a ﬁxed value
will introduce an error as the size will be diﬀerent from the size of reference
summary. Nevertheless, we had to stick to a ﬁxed size.
In these libraries, the output is entire sentences, so the total of words can be
much smaller or larger than the desired output size. For example, the Gensim
library receives the number of desired words, it computes the best sentences and
will append them to the output until the diﬀerence between the desired output
and the generated output is minimized. The Sumy library receives only the
number of desired sentences, so the output may have a size completely diﬀerent
from the size of the reference summary (either much larger or much smaller).
In our dataset, sentence length can vary a lot. It is possible to ﬁnd oneword sentences and sentences with a few hundred words. So, it is fairer to run
our experiments with diﬀerent size parameters. This way the results are not
negatively impacted by an arbitrary choice of size.
4.5

Results

A higher Rouge score reﬂects a higher similarity between the automatically generated summary and the reference summary. Our goal when running this evaluation is to establish how standard extractive algorithms perform on this dataset.
We have no intent in comparing those algorithms, as this would require evaluations under many diﬀerent contexts and parameters.
As Table 1 shows, Rouge F-Score and Recall increase when the summary is
longer. So, for a fair comparison, we used the scores of the runs in which the
absolute diﬀerences between the length of the generated summary and its reference is minimized. Figure 3 shows the scores for Gensim using the desired output
of 80 words, Luhn’s algorithm with a ﬁxed output of one sentence, LexRank and
TextRank algorithms with a ﬁxed output of two sentences.

In our experiments, the Gensim library generally performed slightly better.
But, the highest Rouge-1 F-Score was obtained using the LexRank asking for
four sentences in the Sumy library.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the RulingBR dataset, a corpus that can be used
for natural language summarization. It diﬀers from the existing corpora because
it covers the legal domain and it is in Portuguese. We have analyzed diﬀerent
aspects of the dataset such as its organization, the size of each section, and how
it can be used for the summarization task. We ran an experiment using diﬀerent
algorithms and libraries to establish baseline summarization results.
Despite the fact that the Ementa is a useful summary for legal professionals,
it is not clear that the traditional general approaches for summarization could be
directly applied to the legal domain producing texts that cover the same topics
that a human would select.
The desired summary should contain the main topics discussed in the text.
Perhaps, the desired output summary could be improved by appending these
main topics, named entities, and compound terms. Also, we observed that the
summary is composed of the ﬁnal part of the Ac´
ord˜
ao, the topics taken from the
Relat´
orio, and several ideas discussed in the Voto.
As a future work, we intend to test Neural models for summarization in order
to identify the relevant aspects of the document and generate a summary in the
style produced by a human.
