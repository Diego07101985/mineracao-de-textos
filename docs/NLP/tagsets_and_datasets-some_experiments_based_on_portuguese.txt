Abstract. We report the results of two experiments aimed at investigating the impact of linguistic variation on PoS tagging. In both cases,
we depart from the conversion of the corpus MacMorpho [1], which
was re-annotated according to the Universal Dependencies PoS tagset.
Throughout the conversion process, we faced some linguistic challenges
related to the past participle forms. As a result, we created two corpora (MacMoprho-UD and MacMorpho-UD+PCP). We used these three
corpora (MacMorpho; MacMoprho-UD and MacMorpho-UD+PCP) to
assess the impact on PoS learning in diﬀerent scenarios.

Introduction

Part-of-speech (PoS ) tagging is one of the earliest steps of NLP. However, in
spite of its linguistic nature, linguistic studies comparing the impact of diﬀerent
tagsets on the performance of NLP systems are scarce – from the early work
of [11], which examines the grammatical constructions which cause statistical
n-grams taggers to falter more frequently, and the Eagles document produced in
1996, this seems to be an unattractive subject. On the other hand, comparison
of PoS-taggers doesn’t suﬀer from the same problem. A possible reason for this
imbalance may lie in the belief that the distribution of words along certain categories are based on objective and stable properties associated with words, and
it is up to machines or programmers to develop the best classiﬁcation strategy.
Additionally, a requirement for this kind of study is the existence of comparable
materials – the same corpus annotated with diﬀerent tagsets – a requirement
that seems wasteful considering the amount of work involved.
For the Portuguese language, the disparity between studies focusing on taggers and on tagsets is the same. [13] assess the ambiguity in PoS tagging, considering a morphologic parser. Twenty years later, [7] is the only work we know

which focuses on tagsets, and it is conducted from the computer science perspective only. As to PoS tagger evaluation, on the other hand, the scenario is far
richer, as seen in [9].
In this paper, we present a study on tagsets, originated from the conversion of
the corpus MacMorpho [1], which was re-annotated, at the PoS level, according
to the Universal Dependencies (UD) tagset [16]. Throughout the process, we
faced some linguistic challenges, especially with past participle forms. As a result,
we created a second version of the corpus, in which we kept the UD tagset but
added the PCP tag - speciﬁc for past participles – used in the original MacMorpho
corpus/tagset. We then conducted two experiments: the ﬁrst one aimed to verify
the impact of tagsets – original MacMorpho; MacMorpho-UD; and MacMorphoUD+PCP – on system performance; in the second experiment, taking advantage
of the converted Mac-Morpho-UD corpus, we assessed the impact of size and
quality in training: we used both UD-Portuguese-Bosque [18] and MacMorphoUD in the training phase.

Corpus Conversion

MacMorpho [1] is a Brazilian Portuguese newswire corpus developed within the
scope of the Lacio-Web project [2]. It contains 1.1 million words, annotated at
the PoS level and manually revised. The tagset uses 23 labels. Since 2003, MacMorpho underwent two revisions, eliminating noise and making changes in the
tagset, thus generating MacMorpho version 2 [7] and version 3 [6]. In the ﬁrst
review (version 2), repeated sentences and sentences with missing words were
eliminated. There were also tokenization changes – contractions were considered
a single token. In the second revision (version 3), more repeated sentences or
sentences with missing words were withdrawn, and some PoS tags were simpliﬁed, aiming at achieving a coarser tagset: “auxiliary verb”, “relative connective
pronoun” and “relative connective adverb” were annotated with the more general labels “verb”, “connective pronoun” and “connective adverb”, respectively.
For the present venture, we used the original version of MacMorpho (version 1),
annotated with the original tagset. The choice was motivated by practical issues
regarding the conversion: the Universal Dependencies scheme undo contractions
and contains the tag “auxiliary verb” (AUX). Nevertheless, MacMorpho tagset is
more granular than the UD tagset, with diﬀerences that are not easily circumvented with automatic alignment, thus making the alignment task a source of
interesting linguistic challenges, the main one being past participle forms (for a
detailed version of the conversion, see [22]).
2.1

The Target: Universal Dependencies Tagset

Focusing on multilingual NLP, Universal Dependencies (UD) [16] is a framework for cross-linguistic grammatical annotation that aims at developing a
language-independent annotation scheme, ﬂexible for speciﬁc extensions of a
given language.

The initial UD PoS tasgset was proposed by [17], and consisted of 12 part-ofspeech categories. The current UD tagset contains 17 labels, plus speciﬁc features
that can be used to achieve a more ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation.
The UD 2.0 release contains two corpora for the Portuguese language, and
one of these is the UD-Portuguese-Bosque [18]. This corpus, however, is relatively
small, with 9,370 sentences and 244,675 words. Although missing (to date) syntactic dependencies, MacMorpho corpus has also been revised, and it is widely
used in Portuguese PoS training. Besides making more material available in a
context that looks promising for cross-lingual NLP, we could also investigate the
impact of diﬀerent tagsets in NLP.
2.2

The Alignment

The alignment of diﬀerent tagsets is not a purely mechanical task of conversion.
The same label can be used for diﬀerent purposes, and the fact that two corpora
are annotated with the same tagset does not guarantee that they are aligned1 .
For example, MacMorpho’s tagset has the label NUM, used for numerals. The UD
tagset has exactly the same tag, standing for the same category. However, while
in the UD scheme the orientation is that cardinal numbers should be marked
with NUM, in the MacMorpho corpus, if the numeral is functioning as the head
of a NP, it should be tagged as NOUN. The MacMorpho label PCP has no direct
equivalent in the UD scheme, and along the conversion process, we must choose
between VERB or ADJ. In the following section, we speciﬁcally address the
participles.
Past Participles. In modern Portuguese grammars, there is no doubt that participle forms integrate the class of verbs. However, when we look at the history
of grammatical thought, we came across some interesting facts. In the T´echn´e
grammatik´e, which conveys some seminal ideas of what we mean by grammar,
they are an independent class [3]. For the Stoic philosophers (301 B.C.), participles were considered verbal names, verbs with cases, among other terms that
show their hybrid nature. When parts of speech were translated from Greek into
Latin, the participle (participium) was named precisely for “participating” in
two classes at the same time: nouns and verbs [14]. There is a large number of
occasions in which participles present syntactic properties of both adjectives and
verbs, making a clear-cut identiﬁcation nearly impossible (See [22] for a comparison of contemporary Portuguese grammars regarding past participle forms).
Sentence 1 bellow illustrate this point:
(1) Reﬁro-me mesmo `aqueles programas de interesse mais geral, como as telenovelas, j´
a que nem essas entram `as horas anunciadas. (I’m referring to those
programs of more general interest, such as soap operas, since neither do they
start at the announced/expected hours.)
1

In this paper, we use the term alignment in a broad sense, meaning being equated.

462

C. Freitas et al.

This is not a speciﬁc feature of the Portuguese language, as indicated by [10].
In order to validate the linguistic decisions underlying the PCP conversion, we
conducted a linguistic experiment aimed at verifying the classiﬁcation of past
participle forms by professionals with solid linguistic background. Not surprisingly, the results showed a huge divergence in classiﬁcations. In fact, there were
sentences in which half of the volunteers used the VERB label and the other half
used the ADJ label. Details of the experiment are presented in [22]. Taking into
account the diﬃculty in deciding how to distribute past participles into VERB
or ADJ, we decided to create a second corpus, with a hybrid tagset: UD labels
plus PCP2 . It is worth noting that the PCP label was added to the MacMorpho
tagset precisely to avoid the endless discussion among (human) annotators about
whether past participles should be annotated as verbs or adjectives.

Setting Up the Scene

Corpus and Tagset Conversion. To perform the tagset conversion, we created a set of general rules and a set of speciﬁc rules, designed to account for
individual cases. When there were directly equivalent tags in the tagsets, the
task was simple: we wrote a rule to convert all occurrences of a tag (e.g. PREP)
to its correspondent in the other tagset (in this case, ADP). When there was no
direct equivalence, the procedure was signiﬁcantly more laborious. To convert
PCP, for example, we ﬁrst took a sample of 200 cases where the label appeared
and read the sentences looking for patterns that could become general conversion
rules.
A library in Common Lisp was developed in order to apply the rules. This
library is freely available in https://github.com/own-pt/cl-tag-rewriting and it is
already incorporated in the CL-CONLLU library [15]. The library produces not
only the output data but also some detailed report of the rules applied to each
sentence (log ﬁles). We have also developed auxiliary functions in the library to
analyze the log ﬁles producing some statistics about the rules applications that
helped us, for instance, to identify superﬂuous rules.
Since the rules are stored independently of the corpus, it is trivial to recreate
the corpus. So, even though we used MacMorpho v1 for conversion, converting
the material based on v2 (where sentences were deleted) or v3 is automatic
(although in the latter case some minor work on merging labels will be required).
In this way, we also make it feasible to study the impact on predictive models
of eliminating noise from data, a point that has not yet received the relevance it
deserves [19].
In order to perform the two experiments described in the following section,
we run the Maximum Entropy model (Generalized Iterative Scaling method),
provided by the OpenNLP suite. For both experiments, we merged train and
development partitions.

The UD+PCP corpus, as well as the hybrid tagset, was created with the purpose
of serving as a basis for linguistic and computational experiments; and it is not our
intention to integrate it into the UD consortium.

Experiments

The result of this conversion process is the genesis of three corpora: MacMorphoUD (MacMorpho corpus annotated with the UD tagset), MacMorpho UD+PCP
(MacMorpho corpus annotated with the UD tagset plus the PCP label) and the
original MacMorpho.
4.1

First Experiment

We used the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model provided by the OpenNLP
suite. For each dataset (UD, UD+PCP and original), we trained in the train+dev
partitions and evaluated in the test partition, as provided in the MacMorpho
website. Table 1 presents the results according to each tagset.

The UD+PCP scenario obtained the best results, with a slightly higher performance than the UD tagset. In general, the results point to the success of
less granular tagsets, but they also indicate that the criterion of granularity is
not absolute: the slight advantage of UD+PCP on UD suggests that, in certain
cases, the creation of a class can be a facilitator in learning, bringing consistency. On the other hand, we know that the creation of the PCP label, within
the scope of the Lacio-Web project, was due precisely to the lack of agreement in
the annotation of past participle forms. Thus, the results suggest that, regarding
consistency in learning PoS, the creation of the PCP tag seems to have been an
appropriate decision.
In order to verify whether the diﬀerence between UD and UD+PCP was
due to the ambiguity of the past participle forms, we did an error analysis,
starting from the confusion matrix of each scenario. Tables 3, 4 and 5 present
the confusion matrix of UD+PCP and UD, respectively (predicted labels are the
lines; golden labels are the columns).
As to the UD+PCP scenario, the pairs AUX-VERB (18%), PRON-DET
(7%) and ADJ-NOUN (5%) are responsible for most of the confusion. The ﬁrst
error type/confusion (AUX-VERB) comes as no surprise. Auxiliary verbs are
also verbs, and the deﬁnition of which verbal constructions should be considered
auxiliaries may vary not only between languages, but also between grammarians
in the same language (compare, for example, the analyses provided by [4,5,20]).
It is not a coincidence that one of the changes that took place from version 2
to version 3 in the MacMorpho corpus was the elimination of the distinction

464

between auxiliaries and verbs. The confusion between DET and PRON corresponds to ambiguous words such as o, a, os, as, todos, todas, that can be either
PRON or DET, depending on the context.
Finally, the confusion between ADJ and NOUN is an old acquaintance of all
students of Linguistics – in this case, we speak of a certain “ﬂuctuation” between
nouns and adjectives, which is mainly due to the common practice of naming
something from its qualiﬁcations.
It is also interesting to note the confusion between PCP and NOUN (almost
4%). There is a vast amount of nouns in Portuguese which result from a lexicalization of participle forms, such as resultado. The analysis of a sample of this
confusion suggests that this was the case.
However, to elucidate the diﬀerence between the tagsets, the most interesting confusion is the one between ADJ-VERB and ADJ-PCP on one hand, and
VERB-NOUN and VERB-PCP on the other. None of the four cases stands out
with the tagset UD+PCP.
Considering the confusion matrix in the MacMorpho-UD scenario, as
expected, the main points of confusion observed in the UD+PCP tagset
remained. However, interestingly enough, the confusion matrix also showed a
growth in confusion between ADJ, VERB and NOUN. Table 2 compares the
classes VERB, NOUN and ADJ in the scenarios with and without the PCP
label. The results indicate that the best performance in the tagset UD+PCP
is actually the result of the addition of this label, which plays the role of a
disambiguator, artiﬁcially constructing a consensus where there is none.

Second Experiment

In a second experiment, we used the MacMorpho-UD corpus to verify the impact
of both training size and quality on learning. We created the following test scenarios (in all of them we run the Maximum Entropy model used in Experiment 1):
(A) Training with MacMorpho-UD; evaluation with Bosque-UD test;
(B) Training with the Bosque-UD train; evaluation with Bosque-UD test;
(C) Training with MacMorpho-UD; evaluation with Bosque-UD (complete
Bosque-UD).

This gives us the following three issues for analysis, and the results are in
Table 6: 1. The impact of training size on learning, through the comparison
between scenario B and experiment 1 (corpus MacMorpho UD). 2. The impact
of variation on training and test material, by comparing scenarios A and B. We
note that both corpora (MacMorpho and Bosque) are composed by newspaper
texts, therefore we do not expect much variation. 3. The variation in the size of
the test material, by comparing scenarios A and C.
Surprisingly (for us), the results are mostly aﬀected by the quality of the
training and test materials. The surprise comes from the fact that both corpora
(MacMorpho and Bosque) are journalistic texts, with overlapping materials.

The fact that the performance of the model with the MacMorpho-UD corpus
was good in experiment 1 (0.9607) and close to that of scenario B (0.9504)
discards the hypothesis that the weaker performance in scenarios A and C results
from inconsistencies in the annotation of the MacMorpho-UD. In other words:
in both experiments 1 and scenario B, we trained and tested with the same
corpus (MM-UD and Bosque-UD, respectively) and, in both cases, the results
are close and equally good. We could expect internal inconsistencies in MMUD and Bosque-UD to lead to poor performance, but that was not the case.
Furthermore, since the diﬀerence between scenario B and scenarios A and C is
the variation between training and test material, the diﬀerence in results suggests
one of the two possibilities: (1) an alignment inconsistency between BosqueUD and MacMorpho-UD; or (2) the interference of quality of training and test
materials – in scenarios A and C the corpus used for training was diﬀerent from
the corpus used for testing. To investigate the alignment hypothesis, we turned
again to the analysis of the confusion matrices, looking for patterns that could
indicate inconsistencies between the datasets.
The main confusions are distributed in 3 groups: AUX-VERB; PRONSCONJ and ADJ-NOUN. The confusion between ADJ-NOUN and AUX-VERB
repeats the results observed in experiment 1; the only diﬀerence is in the new
PRON-SCONJ confusion, which might suggest an inconsistency in alignment.
Analysis of a sample of divergent cases, however, rejects this explanation. Almost
all cases refer to the form que (that), which is ambiguous between relative pronoun and subordinate conjunction. The (few) remaining errors refer to quem
(who) or quantos (how many). In none of the cases we noticed systematic errors
from the golden corpus that suggested alignment problems.
Regarding the impact of training size on learning, and if we compare only
experiment 1 (dataset MacMorho-UD) with scenario B – and assuming that both
datasets are equally consistent – we observe a 1% improvement in learning when
there is more training material. It is worth remembering that [8], in the context
of cross-lingual parsing, indicate that the size of the training corpus ceases to be
relevant from a certain amount of data.
Finally, the slightly lower results of scenario C when compared to scenario A
suggest that, with more room for evaluation, performance will decline.

Side Eﬀect: Optimization of Corpus Revision

Throughout the process of analyzing the confusion matrix, we were faced with
confusion data that was not derived from system errors, but from the golden
corpus instead (or errors from both system and golden corpus). Besides pointing
out to an unfair penalization of systems, such errors served as a strategy for an
optimized revision of the MacMorpho corpus annotation. All datasets used in the
present study (and made available in https://github.com/own-pt/macmorphoud) have already incorporated such revisions.

Concluding Remarks

We reported here the results of two experiments aimed at investigating the
impact of (i) variation on tagsets, and (ii) the size and quality of dataset training
in learning.
The ﬁrst experiment was empirically and theoretically motivated. The empirical motivation comes from the conversion of the PoS annotation of the MacMorpho corpus, which was re-annotated with the Universal Dependencies tagset.
It also comes from the fact that there is a lack of an environment that enabled
testing with tagsets. From a theoretical point of view, the study is linguistically
motivated and takes as its starting point the well-known discussion about past
participle forms. As to the second experiment, the results suggest that variation
in size may not be as signiﬁcant as variation in quality.
Error analysis made us realize that much of the systematic confusion reproduces the human divergence in linguistic analysis. The PCP label, the focus of
the study, rightly highlights a boundary zone between two classes. At this point,
it is worth remembering that the development of post-taggers arises as an engineering response to the problem of explosion due to the ambiguity of classes [21].
But the challenge remains when what is at stake is not ambiguity but “fuzziness”. This seems to be the case with past participles. This point relates to
what [12] indicates as non-categorical representations, taking as an example the
V-ing forms of English, which may be ambiguous between nouns and verbs in
the gerund. Such cases would favor the idea of non-discrete classiﬁcations in the
language, with which we agree. When the linguistic annotation method forces
us to use clear categorizations, such as traditional parts of speech classes, it also
shows us how limited this practice can be.
Also in regard to tagsets, an important point is to conduct the evaluation in
subsequent tasks, such as syntactic dependencies. The idea is to investigate the
extent to which it is important to disambiguate the confusions detected for the
subsequent NLP tasks.
As additional contributions of this study, we made available to the community two corpora, plus a revised version of MacMorpho v.1, and we encourage
the community to repeat our experiments. We also provide the conversion and
alignment rules for easily reproduction of the experiments with versions 2 and 3
of MacMorpho. Finally, we indicate that the strategy for error analysis based on

468

confusion matrix seems to be a good way to optimize the linguistic revision. This
is a hypothesis we are investigating and in the near future we hope to develop a
suite for testing and reviewing tagsets.
